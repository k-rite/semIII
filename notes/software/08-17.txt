process is nothin but methodlogy define to perform one or more operations on the input data
it is also know as black box process as only the input and output are more. 
the inner working of the process are not defined.

Flow/arrow :
    which tell you about what input, what output is generated, through and from the process.

Data store:
    they r used in dfd, to represent the data store by the system 
    as one or more processes neeed to use the data at a later stage.
    it may be a output but can be a input to the other process 

Entity:
    consists of attributes and it has real world objects and it is also known as terminator
    As it can be origin of data and final destination of data.

Adv | Freedom from commiting to the technical | 
    |understanding of interrelatedness of system and subsystems
    | Communicationg current sys knowledge with data Flow

Context:  
    |It is the 1st diagram of DFD, It helps system analysist to understand the basic data movement
    |It should be an overview containing a single process and basic input and output.
    |It is also know as highest level diagram.
    |Only external entities are included in the diagram, Data stores are not used in context level.
    |It is numbered as 0.
    |The process name is whole system name.
