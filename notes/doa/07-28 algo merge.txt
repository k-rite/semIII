Algorithm of Merge Sort
1. Start
2. Fetch the number of elements in the list
3. Divide the list in to smaller sub list by dividing into 2 sublist
    a. If the sublist is odd then add 1 element in new sublist
4. Loop steps 2,3 until every element is in seperate sublist respectively
5. Merge the sublist and sort them iteration by iteration.
6. keep on repeating step 5 until all sublists are combined to one.
