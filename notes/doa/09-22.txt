Kruskal Algorithm
spanning trees by adding edge by edge into a growing spanning tree 
It follows greedy approach

MST - Minnimum Spanning Tree

Algorithm
Sort the Graph in non decreasing order by the weight.
Start adding edge to the MST from edge with smallest weight untill the edge of largest edge
Only add edges which doesn't form a cycle, edge which connect only disconnected components
